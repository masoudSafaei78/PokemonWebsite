            Pokémon are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside humans. For the most part, Pokémon do not speak except to utter their names.
            Pokémon are raised and commanded by their owners (called “Trainers”).
            During their adventures, Pokémon grow and become more experienced and even, on occasion, evolve into stronger Pokémon.
            There are currently more than 700 creatures that inhabit the Pokémon universe.

            In the Pokémon Trading Card Game, players build decks around their favorite Pokémon and then play against each other, sending their Pokémon into battle to prove who the best Pokémon Trainer is.
            Players can begin with theme decks—preconstructed decks designed to cover the basics of the game.
            Then, they can augment their card collections with booster packs that provide more cards, letting players develop more diverse decks.
            With thousands of cards to choose from, the game is never the same twice.
            The Pokémon Company International releases four sets of cards, called “expansions,” each year, so the game continues to evolve and expand for both players and collectors.
